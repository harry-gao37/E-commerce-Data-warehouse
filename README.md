# E-commerce-Data-warehouse

> Guli online study website, or called Guli Education System project, with the back end using the currently popular SpringBoot-SpringCloud microservices architecture, uses components such as Feign, Gateway, Hystrix, and Alibaba's Nacos to build the foundation environment for the project. The project also uses MyBatisPlus for persistent layer operations, uses OAuth2-JWT for distributed access, and integrates Spring Security for permission control. In addition, the project uses Alibaba's EasyExcel to implement read and write to Excel, Redis to cache home page data, Git for code version control, and Swagger to generate interface documents.

## Data Collection

As for the back-end interface of the system, the popular SpringBoot+SpringCloud is used for the micro-service architecture, and Feign Gateway Hystrix and Alibaba's Nacos and other components are used to build the basic environment of the project The project also uses MyBatisPlus for the operation of the persistence layer, uses OAuth2+JWT to achieve distributed access, and integrates SpringSecurity for permission control in the project In addition, the project uses Alibaba's EasyExcel to read and write Excel, Redis to cache data on the home page, Git to version control the code, and Swagger is integrated to generate interface documents.

## Data Warehouse Design

The front-end part of the system uses the mainstream front-end framework Vue, uses Es6 development specifications, adopts a modular development model, builds the page environment using the Nuxt framework and vue-admin-template template, and uses Element-ui for page layout. In the front-end environment, Npm is used for dependency management, Babel is used for code conversion, Webpack is used for packaging of static resources, axios is used for Ajax request calls, and ECharts is used for data chart display.
